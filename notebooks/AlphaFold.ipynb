        "\n",
        "This Colab notebook allows you to easily predict the structure of a protein using a slightly simplified version of [AlphaFold v2.1.0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2). \n",
        "\n",
        "**Differences to AlphaFold v2.1.0**\n",
        "\n",
        "In comparison to AlphaFold v2.1.0, this Colab notebook uses **no templates (homologous structures)** and a selected portion of the [BFD database](https://bfd.mmseqs.com/). We have validated these changes on several thousand recent PDB structures. While accuracy will be near-identical to the full AlphaFold system on many targets, a small fraction have a large drop in accuracy due to the smaller MSA and lack of templates. For best reliability, we recommend instead using the [full open source AlphaFold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/), or the [AlphaFold Protein Structure Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/).\n",
        "\n",
        "**This Colab has a small drop in average accuracy for multimers compared to local AlphaFold installation, for full multimer accuracy it is highly recommended to run [AlphaFold locally](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold#running-alphafold).** Moreover, the AlphaFold-Multimer requires searching for MSA for every unique sequence in the complex, hence it is substantially slower. If your notebook times-out due to slow multimer MSA search, we recommend either using Colab Pro or running AlphaFold locally.\n",

        "    *   Run all cells in the Colab, either by running them individually (with the play button on the left side) or via _Runtime_ \u003e _Run all._ Make sure you run all 5 cells in order.\n",
        "    *   The predicted protein structure will be downloaded once all cells have been executed. Note: This can take minutes to hours - see below.\n",
        "*   How long will this take?\n",
        "    *   Downloading the AlphaFold source code can take up to a few minutes.\n",
        "    *   Downloading and installing the third-party software can take up to a few minutes.\n",
        "    *   The search against genetic databases can take minutes to hours.\n",
        "    *   Running AlphaFold and generating the prediction can take minutes to hours, depending on the length of your protein and on which GPU-type Colab has assigned you.\n",

        "    *   Some steps may take minutes to hours to complete.\n",

        "    *   This Colab version of AlphaFold searches a selected portion of the BFD dataset and currently doesn’t use templates, so its accuracy is reduced in comparison to the full version of AlphaFold that is described in the [AlphaFold paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2) and [Github repo](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/) (the full version is available via the inference script).\n",

        "    *   No, everything happens in the cloud on Google Colab.\n",
